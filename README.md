# MinecraftRandomizerTools

## What is this?
A set of tools to play and have fun with Minecraft Randomziers.

[https://fasguy.net/minecraft_randomizer/](https://fasguy.net/minecraft_randomizer/)

The goal is to make it easier to remember / find loot tables and chains.

Two modes, search mode and remember mode.

## Search Mode 
-> Help you find the most important things.

When you play a loot randomizer, the most important things are blaze rods, and then after that it's ender pearls, but there are a ton of things you need.

* blaze rods
* ender pearls
* wood source
* diamond source
* iron source (anvil)
* iridium source
* torches
* emerald
* bastion treasure
* bastion library
* end city loot

You don't need all of things for every run, but it can be helpful. For example, if you can't find ender pearsl, you can trade for them in a village.

The idea is to load the cheat sheet (copy paste? file upload API?), and then save it in localstorage. Then we can render these must-haves with their immediate source. If you left click on the source, then we jump to the next item in the chain. If you right click, we fork and start a new chain looking for the selected item.


This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.1.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
